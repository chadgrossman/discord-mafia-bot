# Mafia Rules
    
__**Goals**__:
Most of the players on the field are Villagers. In a way they're all playing on the same team. One of the players however... is the Mafia. In order for the Mafia to win against the Villagers they have to do two things.

    1) Make their side lose by throwing
    2) Avoid being detected by the Villagers

When the game ends the round is over and everyone votes on who they think the Mafia is. If a majority of the players vote correctly and the mafia is discovered, the villagers win that round. So as the Mafia you need to throw, but be sneaky about it. As a Villager, you need to play as normal as possible and try to win.

The game is three rounds with a new Mafia chosen each round.

__**Scoring**__:
---
If you're a Villager and guess the Mafia correctly, you get **1 point**
If you're the Mafia and avoid detection and are on the losing team, you get **3 points**
Most points at the end of the three rounds wins.
